## 2. IF user is logged in, they'll have an export email signature as a new export icon

## 3. Launches a modal with a preview of their email sig

## 4. Button to copy/export HTML, which they can paste into gmail or outlook signatures

## 5. Use example image below for the format.

## 6. Signature should include the attributes in their profile (name, email, avatar image), and badges in their wallet, which they can select to omit or exclude

## "@saginawj @mbKaleb got a feature idea from customer...pretty cool idea, should be basic front-end development, with some reads from the blockchain metadata."
